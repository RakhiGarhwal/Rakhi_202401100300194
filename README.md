A* Pathfinding Algorithm 🚀

Introduction

This project implements the A (A-Star) Pathfinding Algorithm*, one of the most efficient techniques for finding the shortest path in a grid or graph. A* combines the benefits of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search to optimize search efficiency.


Features

✅ Finds the shortest path efficiently

✅ Uses heuristic-based cost estimation

✅ Works with grid-based and graph-based environments

✅ Suitable for games, robotics, and navigation systems


How It Works

A* calculates the best path by considering:


g(n): The actual cost from the start node to the current node

h(n): The estimated cost from the current node to the goal

f(n) = g(n) + h(n): The total estimated cost

The algorithm selects the node with the lowest f(n) and explores its neighbors until it reaches the goal.


Applications

🕹️ Game AI Navigation

🤖 Robotics Path Planning

🗺️ GPS and Mapping Systems
